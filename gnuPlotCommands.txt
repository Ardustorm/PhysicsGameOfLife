Here is how you can skip n lines:
     plot "foo.dat" every ::n using 1:2 with lines

How to plot multiple files:
    filelist=system("ls *.csv")
    plot for [filename in filelist] filename every ::1 using 1:2

What works:
 filelist=system("ls *.txt")
 plot for [filename in filelist] filename every ::50 using 1:2
